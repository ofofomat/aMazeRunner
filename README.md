# Intelligent robot

The code I wrote for the maze robot project of the second semester at my university;

---
This is an educational code, open-source and free to use, all I ask is *to leave the disclaimer in the code*

It was written using arduino (C++).

### The robot
###### Hardware
1. Arduino nano (1 uni)
2. Motor shield (1 uni)
3. PWC motors (2 uni)
4. Reflectance sensors POLULU (2 uni)
5. Proximity sensor SHARP (1 uni)
6. Bluetooth adaptor HC05 (1 uni)
7. Jumpers for connecting the components
8. And the frame of the robot (build as you want)

###### Software
The main code is called **_A_maze_Runner**, where the setup and loop functions can be found;

**FunctionsHere.cpp(.h)** represents functions I created from scratch to run the robot the way I wanted;

**BluetoothControls.cpp(.h)** represents functions I created using the <SoftwareSerial.h> library for controlling the robot wirelessly

All other documents are libraries that can be found on the internet or even arduino's own site.
